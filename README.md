KubeSkills Daily: A 5-minute Kubernetes test in your inbox every morning

# 🧠 One K8s a Day

**Learn Kubernetes by testing one idea every day.**  
Short, focused experiments that you can run on any cluster in under 10 minutes.  
Each day explores a single Kubernetes concept — from Deployments and NetworkPolicies to Operators, Helm, and Kustomize.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal is to **learn by doing** — and sometimes by breaking things.

Every experiment includes:
- **A clear objective** (what you’ll learn)
- **A minimal YAML or CLI test**
- **A real outcome** (success or failure)
- **A short reflection** (what it means)

You’ll develop muscle memory for daily Kubernetes operations and uncover how different parts of the system interact in practice.

## 🗂 Repository Structure

```
daily/
├── day-001/
│   ├── README.md        # Context, commands, and output
│   └── manifests/       # YAML files
├── day-002/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── manifests/
├── day-003/
│   └── …
└── …
```

Each directory stands alone — no dependencies between days.  
You can start anywhere, but following in order helps build context.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Run in the browser with Killercoda (no system requirements)

Each day includes lightweight YAMLs safe to run in public sandboxes.


### Option 2: Run Locally with Kind or K3s

```bash
# Create a local cluster
kind create cluster --name k8s-lab

# Apply today’s manifests
kubectl apply -f day-001/manifests/

# Explore results
kubectl get all -A
```

## 💡 Example Day Format

Day 5 – Multi-Env Testing with Kustomize

Goal: Patch different deployment variants.  
Command: kubectl apply -k kustomization-examples/env1.  
Observation: env1-my-app deployed with its own labels.  
Lesson: Overlays make environment management trivial.

## 🧠 Why Daily Practice?
- Builds intuition faster than passive reading
- Reinforces core commands through repetition
- Encourages “fail fast” learning habits
- Helps you see Kubernetes as a system, not a checklist
